# Oh My Zsh

### Why install Oh My Zsh?

Your terminal is... not pretty. The default look of bash or zsh can make it very difficult to read. This is actually way more important than it might sound, because being able to quickly read and understand what's going on in your terminal is vital to being comfortable and productive as a developer, because "the command line" is the main way coders interact with local and remote computers.

Oh My Zsh will:

* Make your terminal's data dump much easier to customize.
* Comes out of the box with a great color scheme and prompt setup.
* Has better tab completion to help you avoid typing long file paths.
* Has many amazing extensions, like autosuggesting previous commands.


### How To Install Oh My Zsh

[Oh My Zsh's homepage](https://ohmyz.sh/) has a one-line command to copy-and-paste into your terminal. Sroll down a bit on that page, or hit the `Install oh-my-zsh` button to have your browser do it for you.

**Important:** Don't forget to skip the `$` at the start of the command it gives you!


### Potential Next Steps

Check out Oh My Zsh themes, plugins, and extensions. This author has [a theme](https://www.github.com/abbreviatedman/dangerroom) meant to simplify your prompt, though many programmers swear by the [Powerlevel10K](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme. There are many plugins, but the [autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) and [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) plugins are particularly helpful.

# brew

### Why Install Homebrew?
  
Homebrew (or just `brew`) is a command-line software installer. Think of an app store, except with a lot more software, and without the graphics.

Features:

* The ONLY tool for getting many important coding tools.
* very fast single-source installation... anything we can install through `brew`... we will!
* A selection carefully curated by volunteer coders for quality security, but not subservient to any one company's interest (like most app stores are).
* While it takes more knowledge to use than a graphical app store, it takes far less than installing "from source" (using the actual code files to install.


### How Do I Install brew?

[The Homebrew front page](https://brew.sh/) has a one-line command to copy-and-paste into your terminal.

**Important:** Again, don't forget to skip the `$` at the start of the command it gives you! (I hate that people present terminal commands that way!)



### What Will We Install Through `brew`?

We'll tell you HOW to install all the things in a moment, but let's talk briefly about the WHY for each one.

In the meantime, do not install anything! This will all go more smoothly if we install through `brew` in one step. Also, some of these apps will actually install *very poorly* if not done through `brew`.


##### Visual Studio Code

The absolute premier text editor and dev environment for many languages, most especially JavaScript and TypeScript. User-friendly for beginners, but grows into a powerful dev environment preferred by most front-end engineers.


##### Node

A JavaScript environment run locally through the terminal, this is the tool that's made JavaScript into the powerhouse it is. The back end of the internet is written in JavaScript and run through on Node servers throughout the world.


##### Git
