# Oh My Zsh

### Why install Oh My Zsh?

Your terminal is... not pretty. The default look of bash or zsh can make it very difficult to read. This is actually way more important than it might sound, because being able to quickly read it and understand what's going on is vital to being comfortable and productive on "the command line" (i.e., the termianl), and the command line is the main way coders interact with local and remote computers.

Oh My Zsh will:

* Make your terminal's data dump much easier to customize.
* Comes out of the box with a great color scheme and prompt setup.
* Has better tab completion to help you avoid typing long file paths.
* Has many amazing extensions, like autosuggesting previous commands.


### How To Install Oh My Zsh

[Oh My Zsh's homepage](https://brew.sh/) has a one-line command to copy-and-paste into your terminal. You will have to scroll down a bit or hit the Install oh-my-zsh button to have the page do it for you.

**Important:** Don't forget to skip the `$` at the start!


### Potential Next Steps

Check out Oh My Zsh themes, plugins, and extensions. This author has [a theme](https://www.github.com/abbreviatedman/dangerroom) meant to simplify your prompt, though many programmers swear by the [Powerlevel10K](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme. There are many plugins, but the [autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) and [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) plugins are particularly helpful.

### Why Install Homebrew?
  
Homebrew (or just `brew`) is a command-line software installer. Think of an app store, except with a lot more software, and without the graphics.

Features:

* The ONLY tool for getting many important coding tools.
* very fast single-source installation... anything we can install through `brew`... we will!
* A selection carefully curated by volunteer coders for quality security, but not subservient to any one company's interest (like most app stores are).
* While it takes more knowledge to use than a graphical app store, it takes far less than installing "from source" (using the actual code files to install.


### How Do I Install brew?

[The Homebrew front page](https://brew.sh/) has a one-line command to copy-and-paste into your terminal.

**Important:** Don't forget to skip the `$` at the start!


### What Will We Install Through `brew`?

We'll tell you HOW to install all the things in a moment, but let's talk briefly about the WHY for each one.

In the meantime, do not install anything! This will all go more smoothly if we install through `brew` in one step. Also, some of these apps will actually install *very poorly* if not done through `brew`.


##### Visual Studio Code

The absolute premier text editor and dev environment for many languages, most especially JavaScript and TypeScript. User-friendly 

* Continuously updated by a large team at Microsoft and an even larger team of volunteers/glory hounds. VS Code is always getting better!
* Built with JavaScript/HTML/CSS, as are its many great extensions. With the most popular ecosystem of extensions, this is another way it continuously improves. And you can write your own using the front-end tools you'll learn at Code Immersives!
* Grows with you. If you want to edit text very quickly, its vim extension is hard to beat. If you want to improve your code reliability and refactoring speed, VS Code offers the best TypeScript integration out there, since they're both designed by Microsoft. Although user-friendly for beginners, VS Code is preferred by most front end devs.
